 Data Structures and Algorithms in Python by Scott Barrett  

Using this course to supplement some LeetCode (and LC-like) problems.  I haven't used most of these very much, so despite being in the field for a while, a lot of it is new material.  I'm hoping after some time with this and practice, it will become second-nature.
