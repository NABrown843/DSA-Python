# 2/3/22: Big O and Basic Sorts  

After learning with Andrei's Python course, I feel like I've covered enough of the syntax to get into some data structures and algorithms studies.  I haven't spent a lot of time on DS&A or LeetCode style questions and this showed in a recent interview I had with a FAANG company.  Hindsight being 20/20, I should have studied more and not relied on my work experience.  Completely different ball game.  So here I am, going back to basics on DS&A.  So far, I've only been through Big O notation, which makes sense after watching the videos, and the basic sorts (bubble, selection, insertion).  The concepts of all were really easy to understand, but I had to think through the insertion sort a bit.  It clicked, but I'll definitely need to practice that a bit if there's a chance it would show up in an interview.  I know these sorts have horrible time complexity (worst case O(n^2)), so they aren't really used, but I would still like to cover all my bases.  Hard to rate the course yet, but so far so good.
